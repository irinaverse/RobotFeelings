## Art is vacation for the Soul
Extraordinary stuff in "Robot feelings" and (my feelings) after 2 job interviews in tech companies:

- the word $robot$ is a newcomer to the English language
- conversation from the 1920 play R.U.R. or Rossum's Universal Robots
- metaphysics refers to the branch of philosophy that attempts to understand the fundamental nature of all reality
- work in progress..
