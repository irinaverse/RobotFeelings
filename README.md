*Seated* *Nude* was painted in 1910 by Pablo Picasso and displays a female figure nearly stripped completely of her human form. Instead represented as angular and mechanistic, she retains her pose with a geometric play of light. Critics of the time saw this early cubism as an attempt to show a new world reality in a scientific way.

More extraordinary stuff in my document "Robot feelings":

- the word $robot$ is a newcomer to the English language
- origin word is in Slavic language, $robota$
- dialogue from the 1920 play "Rossum's Universal Robots"
- the play begins in a factory that makes artificial people, called $roboti$ (robots)
- after two job interviews in global tech companies, I started feeling the factory for artificial people
- the things after the physics - metaphysics is significant to humans as we deal with things about which we wonder
- work in progress...
