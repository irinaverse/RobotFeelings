## Art is Vacation for the Soul
Extraordinary stuff in "Robot feelings" and (my feelings) after 2 job interviews in tech companies:

- the word $robot$ is a newcomer to the English language
- conversation from the 1920 play R.U.R. or Rossum's Universal Robots
- abstract ideas and the things after the Physics
- chatting with GPT about difficulties, I really did not expect that answer
- work in progress..
